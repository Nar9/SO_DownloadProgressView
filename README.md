## Progress View in iOS ##

Today, you can build an awesome app, with the most compelling copywriting, strong backend, and few unique features that nobody has implemented yet, but still it’s all not worth if the basic UI of your app is poorly designed.

Poor UI means users cannot understand where to tap for a particular action or don’t know if an action is in the progress or not.

You may have seen these progress bars while downloading a video or downloading an app from Apple App Store.

Here, we’ve created a tutorial on [How to Add Download Button in Your iOS App Using Progress View](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/download-button-ios-progress-view/).

If you want to implement this feature in your iPhone app and looking to Hire [iPhone App Development Company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/iphone-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
